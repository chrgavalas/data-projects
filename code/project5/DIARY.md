About Unaccompanied Minors in EU
The big difficulty I faced was the real scope of the issue I was researching. It was so broad and complex one could easily be derailed. 
For me, the changing moment was when I found out that Europol has been warning there were 10,000 missing unaccompanied minors in Europe in 2016. Missing? Like seriously, completely missing? Do children cross the borders without any guardian and nobody cares to register and protect them, and Europol is sending such a warning message about so many thousands missing? I felt I wanted to pursue this angle of the story.  
After spending many days trying to nail down, not a structured dataset but rather at least some raw, valid numbers to describe what is going on, I realized there arenâ€™t any numbers. Because basically there is not proper mechanism to count this in Europe. And that's why even Europol announces
an approximate number, coming out of only 3 countries. 
I also spent a remarkable amount of time trying to graph all the numbers I got from my dataframes in Numbers. The charts are charming and I consider it a step further from my first project whose graphs were all done with matplotlib but certainly two or three steps away from the real
ability to work with Illustrator. Hope tomorrow's tutorial with our professor will help towards this direction. In any case, I feel like whoever reads my story will get a feeling of how important this issue has become in Europe especially as the continent tries to integrate these children into its society.
