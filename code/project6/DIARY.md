Started working on a project I wanted to do since I were a young sports journalist: Analyze referees' calls. 
I find it very amusing that the sport itself finds the courage to do such an open research about its own inconsistencies. 
I think it shows a clear message of sports civilization, because I firmly believe that we should not curse the refs for any 
mistakes that they make. A ref's mistake is just part of the game, nothing more and nothing less. 
I have cleaned my basic dataset, a set that contains info about all the close games played since March 2015. The sample is 
already big and allows for valid conclusions concerning the behavior of referees, as game time approachs to the end.
