TSIPRAS SPEECHES IN PARLIAMENT PROJECT
13-08-2017
Have downloaded 25 speeches of the Greek PM in parliament before and after July 2015, when he was forced to sign an MoU with Europe, 
a prospect he had been cursing continuously prior to coming to power. 
Have also requested and imported the greek version of Emolex, and have done a preliminary analysis. It looks as if it's better to work
with specific words instead of a complete sentiment analysis. And maybe use the sentiment analysis just for the negative part of his speeches
There's no positivity in his speeches whatsoever, the the findings/comparisons aren't so impressive.
