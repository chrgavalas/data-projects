# TSIPRAS SPEECHES IN PARLIAMENT PROJECT
## 13-08-2017
Have downloaded 25 speeches of the Greek PM in parliament before and after July 2015, when he was forced to sign an MoU with Europe, 
a prospect he had been cursing continuously prior to coming to power. 
Have also requested and imported the greek version of Emolex, and have done a preliminary analysis. It looks as if it's better to work
with specific words instead of a complete sentiment analysis. And maybe use the sentiment analysis just for the negative part of his speeches
There's no positivity in his speeches whatsoever, the the findings/comparisons aren't so impressive.

Have started writing my actual story. After getting a valuable feedback I think I will change the direction of my topic, to make it more about Mr Tsipras being very sentimental in both negative and positive terms right at the time when he signed the MoU with Europe. This is going to be the headline and the core of my story. I will be showing it through two graphs, of both the negativity and the positivity fluctuation over time. It gets spiked in July 2015. 
The second part of my story will be the analysis of the usage of the word 'memorandum' and I will argue that it's been used many more times in his speeches BEFORE he signed it, in his efforts to firmly criticize the previous government and be more likeable to the people. 
But AFTER he signed it, he seems to have massively decrease the use of the word, probably because he wants to be more presidential and to create less anxiety to the people concerning the anti-popular measures his government passes in parliament.
