Link with the AP news report about the latest significant (above 3.0 magnitude) earthquake to hit the eastern part of US.

Wanted to create my own list of the top ten earthquakes in the East of all time and this article seemed quite informative. 
30/07/2017
This article basically lists the ten largest earthquakes in eastern and central US as registered by the USGS. I reformatted it
putting in the two earthquakes in Virginia (2011) and Oklahoma (2016) that were larger and occurred after the article was written.
Was able to basically think about the structure of my story which is the most fundamental part in any journalistic project as far as I am 
concerned. I will present the data clearly stating that the number of earthquakes has increased in this specific part of the country over the last
decade and then I am going to try to explain why this is happening. It's basically because of Oklahoma. 
ANXIETY:
I was only able to divide the country in two, get the lantitudes and longitudes and map all the earthquakes that happened from 1970 to 2017. This way I'm missing some parts of the central US that needed to be in the analysis while at the same time i include some that would equally need to be excluded. I think the best solution would be to create a shape with all the states first, then get a list with lon/lat of all earthquakes and THEN use boundaries (list) to try to say if these earthquakes are WITHIN the boundaries then I want them. I will possibly do it at a later time, it won't change the core of my story, only partly the numbers. 
USED NUMBERS:
I was also able to create some nicer charts in Numbers. I can't use Illustrator and have downloaded Inkscape but don't know yet how to use it. So numbers are doing the work for the time being. I basically pulled out the data from my analysis and integrated them into Numbers to create more visually compelling simple type of graphs. 
NEED TO READ MORE:
I defitely need to read more about the earthquake situation in Oklahoma and better describe why the trend there is so increasing. It will make my story much more powerful. At the end we are journalists and need to explain what the numbers are indicating.
