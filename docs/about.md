I'm a digital journalist from Athens, Greece. Started off my career writing one of the first internet columns in the greek magazine press history at age 18, aiming from early on to bring together my love for writing with new technologies while shoehorning myself into college life and earning a BA in Business Administration from Athens University of Economics and Business. I then got totally focused on journalism, working extensively on stories about politics, economics and foreign news as an editor at MEGA TV's digital desk but also at the greek version of both CNN and Microsoft's MSN. Deep interest in investigative documentaries with specialization in sports, as a member of the Greek Sports Press Association. Have produced my own long form one about African soccer migration to Europe as part of a Master of Arts in Broadcast Journalism which I hold from NYU. Recently attended the Lede Program for data journalism at Columbia University as a Stavros Niarchos Foundation Fellow producing my first data pieces.
